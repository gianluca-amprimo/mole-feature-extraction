# mole-feature-extraction
This project was realised for "ICT for health" course at Politecnico di Torino. It consists in extracting from mole images two metrics to evaluate mole indentation and asymmetryl. These two metrics could be used to perform melanoma recognition in a subsequent step of a ML pipeline.
