# mole-feature-extraction
This project was realised for "ICT for health" course at Politecnico di Torino. It consists in extracting from mole images two metrics to evaluate mole indentation and asymmetry. These two metrics could be used to perform melanoma recognition in a subsequent step of a ML pipeline. 
The code could be largely simplified using convolution function from scipy and filter functions from libraries, but in the assignment it was explicitely requested to implement on our own any kind of filtering.
